    "abstract": "Automated spatial segmentation models can enrich spatio-molecular omics analyses by providing a link to relevant biological structures. We developed segmentation models that use label-free autofluorescence (AF) microscopy to recognize multicellular functional tissue units (FTUs) (glomerulus, proximal tubule, descending thin limb, ascending thick limb, distal tubule, and collecting duct) and gross morphological structures (cortex, outer medulla, and inner medulla) in human kidney. Annotations were curated using highly specific multiplex immunofluorescence and transferred to co-registered AF for model training. All FTUs (except descending thin limb) and gross kidney morphology were segmented with high accuracy: >0.85 F1-score, and Dice-Sorensen coefficients >0.80, respectively. This workflow allowed lipids, profiled by imaging mass spectrometry, to be quantitatively associated with segmented FTUs. The segmentation masks were also used to acquire spatial transcriptomics data from collecting ducts. Consistent with previous literature, we demonstrated differing transcript expression of collecting ducts in inner and outer medulla.",

    "abstract": "Neural representations rely on ability of neuronal assemblies to display organized spiking patterns, despite being embedded within noisy networks. These structured patterns arise from attractor dynamics due to activity reverberation promoted by learnt assembly connectivity. Yet, attractor dynamics have been assessed either under low-noise conditions or in highly idealized neuronal assemblies. Here, in a spiking recurrent neural network model displaying asynchronous irregular noise, we show that realistic spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) imposes either low controllability of attractor recall (when STDP is strong), low stability of attractor maintenance (when STDP is low), or both. Moreover, STDP-built attractors display low independence, i.e., they perturb activity in surrounding network. These constraints may favor self-generated representation switches essential for cognitive flexibility but dampening cognitive reliability. We reveal, by contrast, that several biophysical mechanisms alleviate these issues through a common dynamical principle, protecting excitatory-driven attractorial dynamics from inhibitory-driven spontaneous fluctuations. Amongst biophysical determinants, intrinsic properties were most efficient to increase controllability, stability and independence of attractor dynamics. Specifically, spike-triggered calcium-activated conductances improved reliability by mitigating reliance on connectivity, even at low conductance levels, i.e., in absence of cell-autonomous intrinsic bistability. Finally, we show that mechanisms we identify operate over a large repertoire of static (e.g., Hebbian or ring) and dynamic (e.g., sequences) attractors, with uni- and bidirectional propagation. Altogether, these results pinpoint synaptic and intrinsic synergy as a generic principle to regulate attractor reliability, as a function of cognitive demand.",

In other words, during training, learner must experience success as well as failure. Does there exist an optimal proportion of successes and failures to promote fastest improvements in skill? Here, we build on a recent theoretical framework for optimal machine learning, extending it to the learning of motor skills. We then designed a custom task whose difficulty dynamically changed along with human subjects performance, constraining the error rate during training. In a large behavioral dataset (N=192), we observed evidence that learning is greatest at around a [~]30% error rate, matching our theoretical predictions.",

The underlying genetics can be quite distinct from ones operating at earlier stages of trait innovation. In this work, we have developed multi-stress resistant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus, which diverged from its closest relative >20 million years ago, as a model for interspecies comparative biology and genomics. In growth assays of Kluyveromyces genus, we found that K. marxianus exhibited unique tolerance of high heat and a subset of chemical stress conditions. We then generated and analyzed omic profiles from across the genus to find molecular features associated with- and potentially causal for - K. marxianus traits. Expression profiling revealed divergent lipid processing and membrane transport programs in K. marxianus, borne out in changes in lipid utilization in experimental assays. Sequence analyses found robust evidence for expansions in gene families in K. marxianus genome, most notably among transmembrane transporters and in metabolic enzymes. In molecular-evolution tests, we identified adaptive protein variants throughout K. marxianus genome among which plasma membrane transporters were over-represented. These data enable a model of the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary pressures underlying K. marxianus traits, including adaptive changes to transporters, lipid processing, and membrane functions mediating stress resistance.",

Binding (or swap) errors, where memorized features are erroneously associated with wrong object, can provide a window into the intrinsic limits in capacity of WM that represent a key bottleneck in our cognitive ability. We tested hypothesis that binding in WM is accomplished via neural phase synchrony and that swap errors result from perturbations in this synchrony. Using magnetoencephalography data collected from human subjects in a task designed to induce swap errors, we showed that swaps are characterized by reduced phase-locked oscillatory activity during memory retention, as predicted by an attractor model of spiking neural networks. Further, we found that this reduction arises from increased phase coding variability in the alpha-band over a distributed network of sensorimotor areas. Our findings demonstrate that feature binding in WM is accomplished through phase coding dynamics that emerge from competition between different memories.",

Organellomics analysis quantifies perturbation-induced changes in organelle localization and morphology using a rigorous mixed-effects meta-analytic framework that accounts for sampling variance and experimental heterogeneity. Applying this approach, we delineate phenotypic alterations in neurons carrying ALS-associated mutations and uncover a physical and functional crosstalk between cytoplasmic mislocalized TDP-43, a hallmark of ALS, and processing bodies (P-bodies), membraneless organelles regulating mRNA stability. These findings are validated in patient-derived neurons and human neuropathology.

Here we use comprehensive analyses of a multi-modal dataset from a multi-tasking driving experiment to provide systematic evidence that percentage change in pupil size (PCPS) in human eye gaze is the most reliable biomarker for assessing three human cognitive states relevant to task performance: workload, sense of urgency, and mind wandering. Specifically, we performed comprehensive statistical tests that establish the superior performance of PCPS compared other physiological signals like electroencephalogram (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), respiration, arterial blood pressure (ABP), and skin conductance. Based on eye gaze data, we also characterized the relation between workload and sense of urgency, observing that consecutive occurrences of higher sense of urgency tended to increase overall workload. We also trained five state-of-the-art machine learning models on data to determine their potential for predicting three systemic cognitive states across subjects, showing that four of them had similar highest accuracy in cognitive state classification based on PCPS (with one, random forest, showing inferior performance). In combination with statistical analyses, comparative modeling results demonstrate that PCPS, in contrast to prior findings in literature, represents the optimal method for estimating three performance-relevant cognitive states.",
