      "abstract": "Cell-free systems (CFS) have emerged as transformative tools in synthetic biology, enabling the execution of complex biological reactions such as transcription and translation outside the confines of living cells. By eliminating the cellular membrane, CFS allows unprecedented control over biochemical conditions, facilitating rapid prototyping (up to 10x faster than traditional in vivo systems), streamlined design-build-test cycles, and the direct production of proteins, including those that are toxic or difficult to express in vivo. Rooted in pivotal discoveries from the 1960s, CFS technologies have evolved to include refined systems like the PURE system, freeze-dried diagnostics, and programmable biosynthesis platforms, integrating seamlessly with automation, artificial intelligence, and microfluidics. Modern CFS platforms support a broad range of applications, from on-demand vaccine and therapeutic production to environmental monitoring, protein engineering, and sustainable biomanufacturing. Their modular nature makes them ideal for developing genetic circuits, metabolic pathways, and biosensors, while also accelerating high-throughput screening and educational access through platforms like BioBits. Despite challenges such as reagent costs, batch variability, and scalability, recent advances in energy regeneration, lyophilization, and predictive modelling are progressively addressing these hurdles. Ultimately, CFS is not just a powerful research tool; it represents a paradigm shift toward decentralized, programmable biotechnology. From field-deployable diagnostics to space-based biomolecule synthesis, cell-free systems are paving the way for a more responsive, accessible, and innovative future in biological engineering.",

      "abstract": "The intricate three-dimensional structures of proteins dictate their diverse biological functions. Accurately representing these structures, particularly the fine-grained orientational relationships between amino acids, is crucial for understanding protein mechanisms and practical computational protein analysis. Current methodologies often fall short in capturing these essential geometric details. We introduce Orientation-Aware Graph Neural Networks (OA-GNNs), a novel deep learning framework that explicitly models local and global geometric characteristics, including inner-residue torsion angles and inter-residue orientations. OA-GNNs achieve this by uniquely extending neural network weights from scalars to 3D directed weights and by implementing an equivariant message passing paradigm that ensures SO(3)-equivariance. This approach allows for a richer, more geometrically meaningful processing of protein structural data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OA-GNNs significantly outperform existing methods in sensing orientational features and achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse computational biology tasks, including residue identification, computational protein design, model quality assessment, and protein function classification. Our findings highlight the power of orientation-aware learning and establish OA-GNNs as a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of protein structure-function relationships and for developing new therapeutic and biotechnological solutions.

      "abstract": "The deep integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with research on food-derived peptides (FDPs) signifies a paradigm shift towards intelligent precision design and functional optimization in developing FDP products. Random forests, convolutional neural networks and other machine learning and deep learning technologies have markedly expedited bioactive peptide discovery, functional characterization and structure-activity relationship elucidation, while their comprehensive application confronts critical challenges encompassing dataset integrity, model architecture optimization, interpretability constraints and experimental verification requirements. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the existing limitations and future opportunities of AI technology in the field of FDPs is required. This review evaluates traditional methodologies and AI applications in FDP research, addressing current limitations and prospects. AI faces several challenges in predicting complex protein structures and FDPs. Dimensionality curse and local optima during protein structure prediction reduce accuracy. In FDP prediction, the selection of amino acid descriptors limits model stability. Additionally, the scarcity of FDP datasets leads to accuracy reduction in AI model training and introduces class distribution bias. Traditional cross-entropy loss further exacerbates class distribution skew. These issues collectively constrain the application of AI in FDP prediction. AI enhances peptide screening efficiency through large-scale data processing, reducing research costs. Standardized multidimensional databases integrated with heterogeneous AI architectures improve predictive model accuracy and cross-domain adaptability. Computational visualization frameworks elucidate bioactive determinants and quantitative structure-activity relationships. Metabolomic-gut microbiota interdisciplinary strategies enable the precision design of bioactive peptides for personalized nutrition.

      "abstract": "Molecular structure prediction is essential for understanding therapeutic functions and accelerating pharmaceutical research. While state-of-the-art deep learning models like AlphaFold demonstrate strong performance on general protein backbone prediction, they struggle with critical regions of VHH antibodies, a novel family of molecules underrepresented in current training datasets. Many academic and industry laboratories can generate high-quality VHH structures for novel sequences, presenting an opportunity to improve model performance through iterative fine-tuning with strategically selected new data. However, experimental structure determination requires weeks to months of effort and significant costs per structure, making exhaustive data collection impractical. Randomly curating subset of full collection yields suboptimal improvements, as many structures provide redundant information while key regions remain unexplored. Strategic data selection can identify which structures, once experimentally determined, will maximally improve prediction accuracy, enabling superior model performance with fewer iterations and lower costs. We propose DEWDROP, an active learning selection method that guides VHH structure curation to maximally improve fine-tuned model performance. DEWDROP leverages Monte Carlo dropout to generate prediction ensembles that inform optimal data selection. While we focus on VHH antibodies, underrepresentation issues affect many molecular domains, making DEWDROP broadly applicable as a model-agnostic method for structural biology applications. To demonstrate this effectiveness, we evaluate our approach through retrospective iterative fine-tuning experiments and batch selection analysis on two distinct structural families: VHH antibodies from SAbDab-nano as our target application and primary benchmark and ",

      "abstract": "Precision medicine aims to tailor healthcare by integrating individual genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data, collectively referred to as multi-omic data. However, the scale and complexity of such multi-omics datasets challenge classical computing approaches. Quantum computing, which leverages superposition and entanglement (quantum-level correlations between particles), offers a fundamentally new paradigm for accelerating molecular simulations, biomarker discovery, and high-dimensional data analysis. This review explores the convergence of quantum computing and it's potential to provide unmet needs in precision biomedicine research, with emphasis on applications in diagnostic modeling, multi-omic data integration and drug discovery. We highlight early proof-of-concept studies demonstrating the use of quantum machine learning for disease prediction, quantum algorithms for protein folding, and quantum generative models for novel drug design. Hybrid quantum-classical workflows are also already enabling gene network inference and prioritization of variants of uncertain significance, the latter of which is a major focus of multi-omic research worldwide. Emerging directions include digital twin simulations and real-time clinical decision support powered by quantum models. Looking ahead, the long-term vision for quantum computing in biomedicine involves in silico modeling of entire biological systems to simulate cellular responses to perturbations like drug treatments, enabling clinicians to test therapies in virtual patients before real-world application. Despite these advances, practical implementation remains limited by hardware constraints, qubit decoherence, algorithm scalability, and regulatory barriers. Nonetheless, as quantum hardware evolves and AI-aligned quantum algorithms mature, their integration holds transformative potential. Quantum computing may eventually shorten diagnostic timelines, improve therapeutic precision, and make biomedical innovation more globally accessible.

      "abstract": "In recent years, computational methods such as machine learning and deep learning have been increasingly used to solve various bioinformatics problems related to protein sequence data, such as predicting protein interaction, protein function, subcellular location, and so on. The first crucial step in applying these methods is how to represent a protein sequence as an input feature vector, as the feature vector quality significantly impacts the performance of those methods. A range of protein sequence descriptors has been proposed to enhance the quality of protein sequence representation. Existing descriptors extract information that can be obtained from sequences, such as composition, distribution, spatial correlation between amino acids, and so on. However, improvements can still be made in spatial correlation to capture better sequence similarity, which is valuable for Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) prediction tasks. In this study, our aim is to develop new descriptors based on six well-known sequence descriptors to improve the ability to represent protein sequences. We evaluate the performance of the new descriptors on various PPI datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed descriptors outperform their original versions in terms of PPI prediction performance. This work also introduces ProtSeqDesc (protein sequence descriptors), a flexible Python package that includes 51 types of feature vectors, covering all proposed descriptors. The software package is aimed at meeting the demand for the application of computational methods in bioinformatics.",

We present SPURS, a deep learning framework that rewires and integrates two complementary protein generative models-a protein language model and an inverse folding model-and reprograms this unified framework for stability prediction through supervised fine-tuning on mega-scale thermostability data. SPURS delivers accurate, efficient, and scalable stability predictions and generalizes to unseen proteins and mutations. Beyond stability prediction, SPURS enables broad applications in protein informatics, including zero-shot identification of functional residues, improved low-N protein fitness prediction, and systematic dissection of stability-pathogenicity for human diseases. Together, these capabilities establish SPURS as a versatile tool for advancing protein stability prediction and protein engineering at scale.",

      "abstract": "Leveraging artificial intelligence and deep learning to generate proteins de novo (a.k.a. 'synthetic proteins') has unlocked new frontiers of protein design. Deep learning models trained on protein structures can generate novel protein designs that explore structural landscapes unseen by evolution. This approach enables the development of bespoke binders that target specific proteins and domains through new protein-protein interactions. However, successful binder generation can suffer from low in silico success rates, often requiring thousands of designs and hundreds of GPU hours to obtain enough hits for experimental testing. While workstation implementations are available for binder design, these are limited in both scalability and throughput. There is a lack of efficient open-source protein design pipelines for high-performance computing (HPC) systems that can maximize hardware resources and parallelize the workflow efficiently. Here, we present 'ProteinDJ'-an implementation of a synthetic protein design workflow that is deployable on HPC systems using the Nextflow portable workflow management system and Apptainer containerisation. It parallelizes the workload across both GPUs and CPUs, facilitating generation and testing of hundreds of designs per hour, accelerating the discovery process. ProteinDJ is designed to be modular and includes RoseTTAFold Diffusion (RFdiffusion) or BindCraft for fold generation, ProteinMPNN or Full-Atom MPNN (FAMPNN) for sequence design, and AlphaFold2 or Boltz-2 for prediction and validation of designs and binder-target interfaces, with supporting packages for structural evaluation of designs. ProteinDJ democratizes protein binder design through its robust and user-friendly implementation and provides a framework for future protein design pipelines.

Traditionally conducted in live cells, HTS faces limitations such as cellular toxicity, metabolic interference, and regulatory constraints. Cell-free systems (CFS), which operate in vitro using reconstituted transcription-translation machinery, have emerged as powerful alternatives. These systems circumvent the constraints of cellular physiology, allowing for rapid and tunable expression of biomolecules directly from DNA or RNA templates. This chapter explores the principles, platforms, and applications of CFS-based HTS, highlighting its transformative impact on synthetic biology, drug discovery, diagnostics, and protein engineering. Several cell-free systems are detailed, including those derived from E. coli, wheat germ, rabbit reticulocytes, and the defined PURE system. The integration of CFS with high-throughput platforms such as microplates, droplet microfluidics, and paper-based devices enables cost-effective, scalable, and multiplexed assays. Analytical readouts, including fluorescence, luminescence, mass spectrometry, and digital PCR, provide real-time, sensitive detection of biochemical outputs. Furthermore, automation and machine learning are increasingly incorporated through robotic liquid handling and data-driven DBTL cycles, accelerating discovery and design processes. Despite challenges such as high reagent costs and limited post-translational modifications, innovations such as lyophilized CFS kits, artificial cells, and AI-integrated closed-loop platforms are expanding the frontiers of HTS. Altogether, CFS-based HTS offers a flexible, rapid, and accessible approach for next-generation biomolecular screening and therapeutic development.",

Despite recent advancements in enhanced sampling algorithms, obtaining a converged high-dimensional molecular free energy landscape remains a considerable challenge. To circumvent this issue, we employ a deep multitask learning algorithm that integrates deep neural networks with the established enhanced sampling method of well-tempered metadynamics to iteratively learn the MFEP between reactant and product conformations, without the knowledge of the underlying free energy landscape. Our approach improves upon existing pathway exploration algorithms by following a simpler protocol, thereby eliminating the need to identify intermediate structures along a guess path. From the learned pathway, an automatic reconstruction of a mechanistic fingerprint can be performed by following the sequence of events in the molecular process, allowing for a direct characterization of the molecular mechanism. We demonstrate applications of our algorithm to prototypical chemical reactions, protein folding, and ligand-receptor binding problems. Due to its low computational cost and overall simplicity, this framework is expected to find widespread applications in elucidating molecular mechanisms at all-atom resolution.",

This study introduces a generative framework for co-designing protein sequence and structure in a unified process by modeling their joint distribution, with the goal of enabling cross-modality interactions toward coherent and functional designs. Each residue is represented by three distinct modalities (type, position, and orientation) and modeled using dedicated diffusion processes: multinomial for types, Cartesian for positions, and special orthogonal group SO(3) for orientations. To couple these modalities, we propose a unified architecture, ReverseNet, which employs a shared graph attention encoder to integrate multimodal information and separate projectors to predict each modality. We benchmark our models, JointDiff and JointDiff-x, on unconditional monomer design and conditional motif scaffolding tasks. Compared to two-stage design models that generate sequence and structure separately, our models produce monomer structures with comparable or better designability, while currently lagging in sequence quality and motif scaffolding performance based on computational metrics. However, they are 1-2 orders of magnitude faster and support rapid iterative improvements through classifier-guided sampling. To complement computational evaluations, we experimentally validate our approach through a case study on green fluorescent protein (GFP) design. Several novel, evolutionarily distant variants generated by our models exhibit measurable fluorescence, confirming functional activity. These results demonstrate the feasibility of joint sequence-structure generation and establish a foundation to accelerate functional protein design in future applications.

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of dVGACs closely align with the design models. Cryo-EM structures and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the arginine constrictions undergo voltage-induced conformational changes, serving as both a voltage sensor and a selectivity filter as designed. Notably, the anion selectivity and voltage sensitivity of dVGACs can be tuned through targeted mutations for suppressing neuronal firing in situ.

This field addresses the critical question of how the amino acids sequence determines its three-dimensional structure, a relationship critical to understanding biological function. Over the last four decades, methodologies have evolved from template-based modeling (TBM) and free modeling (FM) to advanced hybrid and end-to-end deep learning approaches. TBM explores sequence homology and threading to predict structures based on a known template, while FM applies physics-based principles to navigate the rugged energy landscape that governs protein folding, predicting de novo stable native conformations. Recent breakthrough methods in protein structure prediction include hybrid methods that integrate physics, bioinformatics, and machine learning, as well as end-to-end methods such as AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold, which have revolutionized the field by using neural networks to directly predict atomic coordinates from sequences, achieving near-experimental accuracy. Protein language models further advance the field by learning sequence-structure-function relationships directly from amino acid sequences, bypassing the need for multiple-sequence alignments. These innovations address the sequence-structure-function paradigm and find applications in drug discovery, enzyme engineering, and disease research.

Here, we explore an understudied form of positive epistasis: intragenic complementation, in which pairs of loss-of-function variants restore near wild-type protein function. Using mutational scanning in yeast, we identify thousands of such interactions in a clinically important enzyme, human argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). Restoration of protein function is not due to the biochemical properties of the substituted amino acids, but rather to a structural feature of the protein, the active site assembly. We develop a machine learning algorithm that uses protein language model embeddings to predict intragenic complementation in ASL with 99.6% accuracy. Additionally, the model trained on ASL generalizes to a structurally related but sequence-divergent enzyme, fumarase, with accuracy over 90%. Our findings reveal a structural basis for this form of epistasis and provide a predictive framework that could extend to at least 4% of human proteins.",

While traditional approaches such as rational design and directed evolution have achieved significant progress, they remain constrained by the vastness of sequence space and the cost of experimental validation. GDL overcomes these limitations by operating on non-Euclidean domains and by capturing the spatial, topological, and physicochemical features that govern protein function. This perspective provides a comprehensive and critical overview of GDL applications in stability prediction, functional annotation, molecular interaction modeling, and de novo protein design. It consolidates methodological principles, architectural diversity, and performance trends across representative studies, emphasizing how GDL enhances interpretability and generalization in protein science. Aimed at both computational method developers and experimental protein engineers, the review bridges algorithmic concepts with practical design considerations, offering guidance on data representation, model selection, and evaluation strategies. By integrating explainable artificial intelligence and structure-based validation within a unified conceptual framework, this work highlights how GDL can serve as a foundation for transparent, interpretable, and autonomous protein design. As GDL converges with generative modeling, molecular simulation, and high-throughput experimentation, it is poised to become a cornerstone technology for next-generation protein engineering and synthetic biology.",

Nevertheless, their inner workings are difficult to explain. Here, we find that a transformer model within the AlphaFold architecture uses simple, sparse patterns of amino acids to select protein conformations. To identify these patterns, we developed a straightforward algorithm called Conformational Attention Analysis Tool (CAAT). CAAT identifies amino acid positions that affect AlphaFold's predictions substantially when modified. These effects are corroborated by experiments in several cases. By contrast, modifying amino acids ignored by CAAT affects AlphaFold predictions less, regardless of experimental ground truth. Our results demonstrate that CAAT successfully identifies the positions of some amino acids important for protein structure prediction, narrowing the search space required to predict effective mutations and suggesting a framework that can be applied to other transformer-based neural networks.",

Current protein deep learning models are predominantly trained on sequence and/or static structure data, which often fail to capture the dynamic nature of proteins. To address this, we introduce SeqDance and ESMDance, two protein language models trained on dynamic biophysical properties derived from molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analyses of over 64,000 proteins. Both models can be directly applied to predict dynamic properties of unseen ordered and disordered proteins. SeqDance, trained from scratch, has attentions that capture dynamic interaction and comovement between residues, and its embeddings encode rich representations of protein dynamics that can be further utilized to predict conformational properties beyond the training tasks via transfer learning. SeqDance predicted dynamic property changes reflect mutation effect on protein folding stability. ESMDance, built upon ESM2 (Evolutionary Scale Model II) outputs, substantially outperforms ESM2 in zero-shot prediction of mutation effects for designed and viral proteins which lack evolutionary information. Together, SeqDance and ESMDance offer a framework for integrating protein dynamics into language models, enabling more generalizable predictions of protein behavior and mutation effects.",

      "abstract": "Understanding how evolutionary constraints shape protein sequences is fundamental to deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying protein stability and function, which has broad implications in protein engineering and therapeutics development. Recent advances in protein language models (pLMs) have enabled accurate prediction of mutation effects through evolutionary information, effectively capturing the selective pressure that governs protein sequence variation. A critical challenge, however, remains in disentangling the intertwined mutation effects on protein stability and function, as evolutionary signals conflate both stability-driven and function-driven pressures, obscuring the mechanistic basis of mutation effects and limiting their utility for rational protein engineering. In this work, we introduce DETANGO, a novel deep learning framework that explicitly deconvolves the mutation effects on protein functions by removing components attributable to stability perturbations from the pLM-predicted mutation effects. Guided by computational or experimental stability measurements, DETANGO estimates a functional plausibility score for each single-point mutation that is the component of the mutation effect not accounted for by changes in stability. Single-point mutations with low functional plausibilities are predicted to be stable-but-inactive (SBI) variants, whose compromised activities are caused by direct perturbations on functional mechanisms rather than structural stability. Residues enriched for such variants are inferred to be functionally critical, as indicated by the strong evolutionary pressures to maintain protein function. Through extensive benchmarking experiments, we show that DETANGO accurately identifies SBI variants and pinpoints functionally important residues across contexts, including ligand binding, catalysis, and allostery. Moreover, extending DETANGO from individual proteins to homologous protein families reveals shared and distinctive functional patterns across protein families. Collectively, these results establish DETANGO as a biologically grounded framework for disentangling evolutionary constraints on protein stability and function, advancing mechanistic understanding of protein function, and informing rational protein engineering.",

This narrative review synthesizes applications reported in the 2022-2025 literature across human, microbial, and viral systems, drawing on peer-reviewed studies as our data source. Representative examples include modeling of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in virology, assisting cryo-EM interpretation of bacterial ribosomal and membrane-protein complexes in microbiology, and refining conformational hypotheses for human GPCRs in biomedicine. Across these cases, AlphaFold predictions have complemented experimental workflows by accelerating hypothesis generation, improving model fitting within ambiguous density regions (poorly resolved areas of cryo-EM maps), and guiding mutagenesis strategies to probe dynamic conformational states. We also summarize recent method extensions: AlphaFold-Multimer improves multi-chain complex assembly prediction, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations augment AlphaFold's static models by sampling conformational flexibility and testing stability. Despite these advances, important limitations remain-particularly for intrinsically disordered regions, protein-ligand and protein-cofactor interactions, and very large or transient assemblies-and current community benchmarks indicate that approximately one-third of residues may lack atomistic precision, underscoring uncertainty in flexible or modified segments. Framed within a clear chronological window and evidence base, our analysis highlights both the practical impact and the remaining challenges of integrating AlphaFold with experiment, outlining priorities where further methodological innovation and orthogonal validation are needed.",

Beyond the enzymes already annotated lie an astronomical number of biocatalysts that could enable sustainable chemical production, degrade toxic pollutants, and advance disease diagnosis and treatment. For the past few decades, directed evolution has been a powerful strategy for reshaping enzymes to access new chemical transformations: by harnessing nature's existing diversity as a starting point and taking inspiration from nature's most powerful design process, evolution, to modify enzymes incrementally. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have started revolutionizing how we understand and compose the language of life. In this perspective, we discuss a vision for AI-driven enzyme discovery to unveil a world of enzymes that transcends biological evolution and perhaps offers a route to genetically encoding almost any chemistry.",

Starting from random sequences, we design α-, β-, and αβ-solenoid backbones, generating structures that span natural and novel solenoid space. We experimentally characterise 41 solenoid designs, with α-solenoids consistently folding as intended, including one structurally validated design that closely matches the design model. All β-solenoids initially failed, reflecting the difficulty of designing β-strand majority proteins.

      "abstract": "Whole-brain simulations are a valuable tool for gaining insight into the multiscale processes that regulate brain activity. Due to the complexity of the brain, it is impractical to include all microscopic details in a simulation. Hence, researchers often simulate the brain as a network of coupled neural masses, each described by a mean-field model. These models capture the essential features of neuronal populations while approximating most biophysical details. However, it may be important to include certain parameters that significantly impact brain function. The concentration of ions in the extracellular space is one key factor to consider, as its fluctuations can be associated with healthy and pathological brain states. In this paper, we develop a new mean-field model of a population of Hodgkin-Huxley-type neurons, retaining a microscopic perspective on the ion-exchange mechanisms driving neuronal activity. This allows us to maintain biophysical interpretability while bridging the gap between micro- and macro-scale mechanisms. Our model is able to reproduce a wide range of activity patterns, also observed in large neural network simulations. Specifically, slow-changing ion concentrations modulate the fast neuroelectric activity, a feature of our model that we validated through in vitro experiments. By studying how changes in extracellular ionic conditions can affect whole-brain dynamics, this model serves as a foundation to measure biomarkers of pathological activity and provide potential therapeutic targets in cases of brain dysfunctions like epilepsy.",

Furthermore, our structure-guided approach is effective in the identification of microbial-host isozymes.

CovaGEN generates ligands from a drug-like latent space while conditioning on target sequences and employing a classifier to guide the formation of desirable covalent warheads. A reinforcement learning strategy further optimizes the safety profiles of generated molecules. Experimental results demonstrate that CovaGEN effectively generates covalent drugs with the desired covalent warheads, exhibiting strong target protein affinity, favorable drug-likeness, and low toxicity. When applied to EGFR T790M and Mpro, the generated compounds exhibit higher probabilities of covalent binding. Overall, CovaGEN offers a pioneering approach for the de novo design of covalent inhibitors, advancing the discovery of covalent drugs with improved properties.",

      "abstract": "De novo protein design has seen major success in scaffolding single functional motifs; however, in nature, most proteins present multiple functional sites. Here, we describe an approach to simultaneously scaffold multiple functional sites in a single-domain protein using deep learning. We designed small single-domain immunogens, under 130 residues, that present three distinct and irregular motifs from respiratory syncytial virus. These motifs together comprise nearly half of the designed proteins; hence, the overall folds are quite unusual with little global similarity to proteins in the Protein Data Bank. Despite this, X-ray crystal structures confirmed the accuracy of presentation of each of the motifs and the multiepitope design yields improved cross-reactive titers and neutralizing response compared to a single-epitope immunogen. The successful presentation of three distinct binding surfaces in a small single-domain protein highlights the power of generative deep learning methods to solve complex protein design problems.",

      "abstract": "Enzyme engineering involves enhancing enzyme function and application through multidimensional technological systems. Its development encompasses elucidating sequence-structure-function relationships, exploring fitness landscapes, and multiscale regulation. Conventional enzyme engineering strategies include directed evolution (DE), rational/semi-rational design, residue co-evolution, and de novo design. DE mimics natural selection but is limited by high-throughput screening efficiency. Rational/semi-rational design integrates computational simulation with experimental validation to regulate enzyme performance. Residue co-evolution combines sequence co-evolution analysis and kinetic simulations, and de novo design is dedicated to achieving precise protein folding through physical modeling. In recent years, the breakthrough progress in machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL), has significantly enhanced the efficiency of all the above-mentioned methods; by accurately predicting mutational effects and efficiently exploring discontinuous sequence space, it provides powerful tools to improve or supplement the above strategies, thereby aiding in escaping local fitness optima traps. This review summarizes common strategies in enzyme engineering, including directed evolution, rational/semi-rational design, residue co-evolution, and de novo design, and further introduces the latest applications of ML and DL models in each of these fields. Although challenges persist, such as force field accuracy limitations, mutation sampling constraints, experimental throughput limitations, and epistatic effects, more comprehensive multimodal foundation models in the future are expected to integrate cross-scale parameters for intelligent design, and the establishment of standardized enzymology databases will enhance prediction reliability. Overall, AI-empowered enzyme engineering will drive a profound transformation toward a predictable and highly efficient pathway for enzyme design, providing more precise and powerful solutions for biocatalysis.",

This process relies on the iterative Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle, where experimental feedback guides progressive improvements. Advancements in artificial intelligence have transformed both the Design and Learn phases, with zero-shot protein language models predicting beneficial mutations directly from sequence data and supervised models integrating assay results to refine subsequent variant designs. These approaches reduce the dependence on structural insights while enabling the discovery of synergistic effects across mutations. Automation technologies, including robotic liquid handlers and integrated platforms, have become central to modern protein engineering by reducing errors, ensuring reproducibility, and enabling large-scale variant screening. Emerging autonomous platforms demonstrate closed-loop optimization that couples protein library design, automated plasmid transformation/protein expression and corresponding assays, and machine learning-driven decision-making. These systems achieve significant accelerations in the research process, reducing multi-round engineering cycles from months to days while successfully improving diverse proteins/enzymes to a targeted objective. Beyond single-lab platforms, orchestration frameworks adhering to FAIR data principles and leveraging knowledge graphs promise distributed 'self-driving' laboratories capable of coordinating workflows across facilities. While high setup costs and proprietary systems remain challenging, open-source and modular alternatives highlight a path toward transparent, flexible automation.

      "abstract": "Most behavioral studies in animals investigate risk using outcome probabilities larger than 10%. However, real-world Decision-Making often requires evaluating events that are both extremely unlikely and highly consequential. To address this gap, we developed an experimental and computational framework to quantify how rats detect and adapt to rare (probability < 1%) and extreme (deviation from mean > 10 standard deviations) outcomes (REE). Using a four-armed bandit task, animals chose between options associated with probabilistic rewards (sugar pellets) or punishments (time-out delays). Depending on the animals choice, REE can occur or not, allowing us to probe how rats integrate information across both common and fat-tailed event distributions. Across subjects, behavior showed restricted diversification (typically two out of f our options) and clear sensitivity to REE, expressed as a systematic avoidance of rare and extreme punishments (\"Black Swans\") combined with partial exposure to rare and extreme gains (\"Jackpots\"). The dominant behavioral phenotype displayed a near-complete suppression of exposure to Black Swans, whereas exposure to Jackpots remained only moderate. This asymmetric sensitivity came at a cost: these animals accepted smaller frequent gains and larger frequent losses to avoid catastrophic outcomes. To account for these behaviors, we implemented an augmented reinforcement learning model in which REE are weighted separately from frequent events. Fitting this model to individual behavioral data captured subjects decision patterns far better than standard Q-learning, which systematically failed to reproduce the observed asymmetry. The best-fitting model suggests that the rat brain segregates information from the central outcome distribution and the distribution tails, assigning distinct value weights to REE during action selection. This work provides the first evidence that rodents spontaneously adapt their learning strategies to avoid extreme punishments while partially maintaining exposure to rare and extreme gains, suggesting that frequent outcomes are treated separately from rare and extreme ones through different weights in Decision-Making.",

Deep learning (DL) has shown promise in forecasting the effects of such mutations, but is hindered by two primary constraints. First, the structures of mutant proteins are often elusive to acquire. Secondly, PPI takes place dynamically, which is rarely integrated into the DL architecture design. To address these obstacles, we present a novel framework named Refine-PPI with two key enhancements. First, we introduce a structure refinement module trained by a mask mutation modeling (MMM) task on available wild-type structures, which is then transferred to produce the inaccessible mutant structures. Second, we employ a new kind of geometric network, called the probability density cloud network (PDC-Net), to capture 3D dynamic variations and encode the atomic uncertainty associated with PPI. Comprehensive experiments on SKEMPI.v2 substantiate the superiority of Refine-PPI over all existing tools for predicting free energy change. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our hallucination strategy and the PDC module in addressing the absence of mutant protein structure and modeling geometric uncertainty.",

Targets included systems with experimental structures determined in two or three states, evaluated by direct comparison to experimental coordinates, as well as domain-linker-domain (D-L-D) targets assessed against statistical models generated from NMR and SAXS data. This paper focuses on the former class of multi-state targets. Ten ensembles were released as community challenges, including ligand-induced conformational changes, protein-DNA complexes, a trimeric protein, a stem-loop RNA, and multiple oligomeric states of a single RNA. For five targets, some groups produced reasonably accurate models of both reference states (best TM-score > 0.75). However, with the exception of one protein-ligand complex (T1214), where an apo structure was available as a template, predictors generally failed to capture key structural details distinguishing the states. Overall, accuracy was significantly lower than for single-state targets in other CASP experiments. The most successful approaches generated multiple AlphaFold2 models using enhanced multiple sequence alignments and sampling protocols, followed by model quality-based selection. Although the AlphaFold3 server performed well on several targets, individual groups outperformed it in specific cases. By contrast, predictions for one protein-DNA complex, three RNA targets, and multiple oligomeric RNA states consistently fell short (TM-score < 0.75). These results highlight both progress and persistent challenges in multi-state prediction. Despite recent advances, accurate modeling of conformational ensembles, particularly RNA and large multimeric assemblies, remains an important frontier for structural biology.",

Researchers have found and systematically summarized 14 distinct types of GPCRs in fungi but their distribution among numerous fungal species remained largely unexamined. Additionally, three families of mammalian homologs (Rhodopsin, Glutamate, and Frizzled) have been found in previous studies, but they are not included in the systematic classification of fungal GPCRs. Our study establishes a unified classification of 17 GPCR classes in fungi, combining 14 fungal and 3 mammalian previously recognized groups, and classifies 28,294 GPCRs across 1357 fungal species, significantly expanding the scale of GPCRs in fungi and demonstrating their broader distribution. We found that mammalian homologs are notably more prevalent in Early Diverging Fungi (EDF), whereas the previous 14 classes are predominantly found in Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The most abundant class detected in fungi was Pth11-like GPCRs, exclusively found in Pezizomycotina and involved in fungal pathogenicity. Our analysis suggested that Pezizomycotina ancestor possessed an extensive array of Pth11-like GPCRs, but over time, some species underwent considerable reductions in these GPCRs in conjunction with genome contractions. Utilizing a custom-built convolutional neural network (CNN) for the identification of fungal GPCRs, we identified several putative novel fungal GPCRs. Predicted interactions between these prospective new GPCRs and G-alpha proteins, as simulated by AlphaFold Multimer, provided additional support for their functional relevance. In conclusion, our work defines the first large-scale, unified classification of fungal GPCRs, reveals lineage-specific expansions and contractions, and uncovers previously unrecognized GPCR candidates with potential functional roles in fungal signaling.",

      "abstract": "Accurate identification of protein-ligand binding sites is an essential step in structure-based drug discovery. Herein, we present SwinSite, a deep learning framework that leverages a hybrid architecture combining 3D convolutional neural networks and hierarchical vision transformer modules to predict ligand binding sites based on a 3D structure of a target protein. SwinSite encodes spatial information by voxelizing a protein structure into 3D grids centered around surface residues, allowing for a detailed spatial representation of the protein's surface environment. By combining local feature extraction with hierarchical self-attention via shifted windows, SwinSite effectively captures both fine-grained geometric features and long-range dependencies. Evaluations on multiple benchmark data sets demonstrate that SwinSite outperforms existing CNN- and GNN-based ligand binding site detection methods consistently, highlighting its robustness and generalization ability.",

In this paper, we study diffusion models through the lens of theoretical biophysics, analyzing their underlying formulation of potentials and exploring their applications in scoring protein interactions. We develop simple theories rooted in statistical physics that relate thermodynamic potentials to the negative log of the probability of observing a system in a particular state.

Current deep learning classifiers provide accurate predictions but offer neither uncertainty estimates nor insight into which features matter most. On the other hand, while diffusion models excel at generating new samples from learned distributions, they have seen limited use in classification and prediction tasks. We introduce a physics-inspired conceptual approach, which we name Keeping SCORE, that transforms diffusion models into probabilistic engines for classification and regression. By measuring dissipation along noising trajectories under different class assumptions, we calculate exact class likelihoods and quantify prediction confidence. Our approach is naturally accompanied by feature attributions that identify which input variables drive each decision, providing interpretability without modifying existing trained models. We test our framework across image recognition tasks (handwritten digits, natural photos), single-cell genomics (distinguishing cell identities, mapping gene perturbation effects), and molecular biophysics (predicting mutation impacts on protein folding energy), showing accurate probability estimates alongside explanations through physically meaningful coordinates. This connection between non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and modern AI approaches creates interpretable, uncertainty-aware predictions for biological discovery.",

      "abstract": "Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) represent a transformative approach to drug development by leveraging the intracellular ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) for the selective degradation of target proteins. A PROTAC molecule comprises three essential components: a ligand that binds to the E3 ubiquitin ligase, a ligand that targets the protein of interest, and a flexible linker that connects the two. This distinctive structure enables the PROTAC to simultaneously engage with both the target protein and the E3 ligase, facilitating their interaction. Such proximity initiates the ubiquitination of the target protein, marking it for recognition and subsequent degradation. In this study, we benchmark ternary complexes based on PROTACs using four recently employed predictive tools: Chai-1, AlphaFold2, AlphaFold3, and Protenix. Comparative analysis indicated that the ternary complexes predicted by the four prediction tools demonstrated satisfactory accuracy (Cα-RMSD < 10 Å). Among the evaluated tools, three-Chai-1, AlphaFold3, and Protenix-demonstrated superior performance in over half of the tests, while AlphaFold2 exhibited comparatively lower performance. However, significant challenges remained in accurately predicting the orientation of POI and the E3 ligase (Cα-RMSD < 10 Å when POI or E3 ligase were used as reference), as well as the position of the small molecule PROTAC (RMSD < 5 Å). By benchmarking these tools, we underscore recent advancements in protein structure prediction, enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning PROTAC complexes, and provide a valuable reference for evaluating the binding conformations of other ternary complexes, as well as for the development of future predictive tools.",

      "abstract": "Neural representations rely on the ability of neuronal assemblies to display organized spiking patterns, despite being embedded within noisy networks. These structured patterns arise from attractor dynamics due to activity reverberation promoted by learnt assembly connectivity. Yet, attractor dynamics have been assessed either under low-noise conditions or in highly idealized neuronal assemblies. Here, in a spiking recurrent neural network model displaying asynchronous irregular noise, we show that realistic spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) imposes either low controllability of attractor recall (when STDP is strong), low stability of attractor maintenance (when STDP is low), or both. Moreover, STDP-built attractors display low independence, i.e., they perturb activity in the surrounding network. These constraints may favor self-generated representation switches essential for cognitive flexibility but dampening cognitive reliability. We reveal, by contrast, that several biophysical mechanisms alleviate these issues through a common dynamical principle, protecting excitatory-driven attractorial dynamics from inhibitory-driven spontaneous fluctuations. Amongst biophysical determinants, intrinsic properties were most efficient to increase controllability, stability and independence of attractor dynamics. Specifically, spike-triggered calcium-activated conductances improved reliability by mitigating reliance on connectivity, even at low conductance levels, i.e., in the absence of cell-autonomous intrinsic bistability. Finally, we show that the mechanisms we identify operate over a large repertoire of static (e.g., Hebbian or ring) and dynamic (e.g., sequences) attractors, with uni- and bidirectional propagation. Altogether, these results pinpoint synaptic and intrinsic synergy as a generic principle to regulate attractor reliability, as a function of the cognitive demand.",

Yet, protein bioengineering poses unique challenges for sequence representation, as experimental datasets typically feature few mutations, which are either sparsely distributed across the entire sequence or densely concentrated within localized regions. This limits the ability of sequence-level representations to extract functionally meaningful signals. In addition, comprehensive comparative studies remain scarce, despite their crucial role in clarifying which representations best encode relevant information and ultimately support superior predictive performance. In this study, we systematically evaluate multiple ProtBERT and ESM2 embedding variants as sequence representations, using the adeno-associated virus capsid as a case study and prototypical example of bioengineering, where functional optimization is targeted through highly localized sequence variation within an otherwise large protein. Our results reveal that, prior to fine-tuning, amino acid-level embeddings outperform sequence-level representations in supervised predictive tasks, whereas the latter tend to be more effective in unsupervised settings. However, optimal performance is only achieved when embeddings are fine-tuned with task-specific labels, with sequence-level representations providing the best performance. Moreover, our findings indicate that the extent of sequence variation required to produce notable shifts in sequence representations exceeds what is typically explored in bioengineering studies, showing the need for fine-tuning in datasets characterized by sparse or highly localized mutations.",

This perspective examines how large language model (LLM) agents bridge the gap between computational predictions and physical experimentation through intelligent orchestration of complex experimental workflows. Unlike traditional automation following rigid scripts, LLM-powered systems dynamically generate protocols, translate them into machine commands, coordinate resources, and adapt to experimental feedback in real-time. This short perspective covers multi-agent frameworks from recent implementations and presents case studies showcasing closed-loop design-build-test-learn iterations in enzyme engineering. These systems provide both standardization and flexibility needed to handle complex, context-dependent experimental decisions, potentially accelerating enzyme engineering while enhancing accessibility to sophisticated AI capabilities.",

Training on limited data can lead to overfitting and poor generalizability to sequences distant from those in the training set. Additionally, inadequate use of scarce and disparate data can introduce biases during evaluation, leading to unreliable model performances being reported. Here, we present a comprehensive study exploring various approaches for protein fitness prediction from limited data, leveraging pre-trained embeddings, repeated stratified nested cross-validation, and ensemble learning to ensure an unbiased assessment of the performances. We applied our framework to introduce NanoMelt, a predictor of nanobody thermostability trained with a dataset of 640 measurements of apparent melting temperature, obtained by integrating data from the literature with 129 new measurements from this study. We find that an ensemble model stacking multiple regression using diverse sequence embeddings achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting nanobody thermostability. We further demonstrate NanoMelt's potential to streamline nanobody development by guiding the selection of highly stable nanobodies. We make the curated dataset of nanobody thermostability freely available and NanoMelt accessible as a downloadable software and webserver.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid growth of sequencing data has exacerbated the problem of functional annotation of protein sequences, as traditional homology-based methods face limitations when working with distant homologs, making it difficult to accurately determine protein functions. This paper introduces the OrthoML2GO method for protein function prediction, which integrates homology searches using the USEARCH algorithm, orthogroup analysis based on OrthoDB version 12.0, and a machine learning algorithm (gradient boosting). A key feature of our approach is the use of orthogroup information to account for the evolutionary and functional similarity of proteins and the application of machine learning to refine the assigned GO terms for the target sequence. To select the optimal algorithm for protein annotation, the following approaches were applied sequentially: the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) method; a method based on the annotation of the orthogroup most represented in the k-nearest homologs (OG); a method of verifying the GO terms identified in the previous stage using machine learning algorithms. A comparison of the prediction accuracy of GO terms using the OrthoML2GO method with the Blast2GO and PANNZER2 annotation programs was performed on sequence samples from both individual organisms (humans, Arabidopsis) and a combined sample represented by different taxa. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is comparable to, and by some evaluation metrics outperforms, these existing methods in terms of the quality of protein function prediction, especially on large and heterogeneous samples of organisms. The greatest performance improvement is achieved by combining information about the closest homologs and orthogroups with verification of terms using machine learning methods. Our approach demonstrates high performance for large-scale automatic protein annotation, and prospects for further development include optimizing machine learning model parameters for specific biological tasks and integrating additional sources of structural and functional information, which will further improve the method's accuracy and versatility. In addition, the introduction of new bioinformatics tools and the expansion of the annotated protein database will contribute to the further improvement of the proposed approach.",

Many current predictors represent MHC class I alleles using selected subsets of residues, known as pseudosequences, yet the extent to which pseudosequence choice and encoding strategy influence predictive performance has not been systematically examined. This study addresses that gap by evaluating a range of MHC representations within the BigMHC EL framework. We compared pseudosequence definitions based on protein structure and evolutionary diversity, a randomly sampled pseudosequence baseline, pseudosequences of varying lengths, embeddings generated using the ESM-2 protein language model, and a graph-based annotation embedding derived from allele groupings. Models using biologically informed pseudosequences consistently outperformed the random baseline, underscoring the importance of residue selection. Protein structure and evolutionary diversity pseudosequences showed similar performance, likely reflecting overlap in residues near the peptide-binding groove. We also found that pseudosequences of approximately 30 to 35 residues produced the strongest performance. Lastly, ESM-2 and annotation-based embeddings outperformed the random baseline but did not surpass curated pseudosequences under the current setup. Together, these findings indicate that curated pseudosequences remain efficient representations of MHC alleles in neoantigen prediction models, while alternative encodings can approximate but not yet replace residue-level sequence information.",

A number of recent efforts to use machine-learning-based predictors to improve sequence selection have led to remarkable improvements in efficiency, but the sparse data at each experimental iteration restricts these approaches to extremely simple models. Adapting large-scale pre-trained protein language models using experimental data offers an alternative that we show productively leverages the strong inductive biases of the natural distribution of protein sequences to navigate high-dimensional, combinatorially large fitness landscapes. Our approach uses a general-purpose \"post-training\" algorithm grounded in statistical physics that employs quantitative experimental rankings to directly produce a sampler for diverse, high fitness sequences with fewer data points than competing methods. The resulting adapted protein language model can itself be studied and interpreted, shedding further light on the biophysical characteristics of highly fit sequences and their properties.",

The assignment involved generating quizzes from lecture notes on protein structure and apoptosis, verifying ChatGPT's answers, and engaging in further inquiry. Students completed a Qualtrics survey assessing their perceptions. Nearly 60% of students had no prior ChatGPT experience, and only 21% had used it for previous quizzing purposes. Most (96%) found the instructions for the assignment clear, and 89% reported that ChatGPT was easy to use. The majority believed ChatGPT quizzes were as effective as instructor-provided quizzes. All students agreed that verifying ChatGPT's answers with lecture notes was a valuable learning experience. Open-ended responses highlighted the ease of generating additional questions and exploring concepts at higher cognitive levels, though some noted challenges with crafting precise prompts and verifying answers. Although many students were new to ChatGPT, the structured assignment improved their comfort with and understanding of the platform's capabilities and limitations when used for active recall and critical inquiry.

      "abstract": "The lack of experimental structures for the majority of protein-protein complexes has motivated the development of a variety of strategies for the structural modeling of protein complexes, such as computational docking, in active development for the last decades, and the more recent artificial intelligence (AI)-based ground-breaking methodologies. Among the existing computational docking methods, Python docking (pyDock) has shown competitive predictive rates and high robustness over the years. However, the field has dramatically changed with the appearance of artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods, like AlphaFold. While structure prediction of individual proteins is virtually solved by this program, the focus is now on how to improve the prediction of challenging cases like antibody-antigen complexes, multiprotein complexes, weak interactions, or highly flexible interacting proteins. Successful strategies are based on the generation of more diverse sets of models and the integration with other \"classical\" approaches that facilitate the identification of the correct models. Here, we will show in practical terms how to combine the structural modeling capabilities of AlphaFold with the energy-based scoring function in pyDock to improve structural predictions in challenging protein-protein complexes.",

We present a computational pipeline for the discovery and design of therapeutic antibody candidates, which incorporates physics- and AI-based methods for the generation, assessment, and validation of candidate antibodies with improved developability against diverse epitopes, via efficient few-shot experimental screens. We demonstrate that these orthogonal methods can lead to promising designs. We evaluated our approach by experimentally testing a small number of candidates against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants in three different tasks: (i) traversing sequence landscapes of binders, we identify highly sequence dissimilar antibodies that retain binding to the Wuhan strain, (ii) rescuing binding from escape mutations, we show up to 54% of designs gain binding affinity to a new subvariant and (iii) improving developability characteristics of antibodies while retaining binding properties. These results together demonstrate an end-to-end antibody design pipeline with applicability across a wide range of antibody design tasks. We experimentally characterized binding against different antigen targets, developability profiles, and cryo-EM structures of designed antibodies. Our work demonstrates how combined AI and physics computational methods improve productivity and viability of antibody designs.",

However, generating diverse multi-domain proteins with robust enzymatic properties remains challenging. Here we use an artificial intelligence-driven strategy that couples structure-guided inverse protein folding with evolution-informed residue constraints to generate active, divergent variants of TnpB, a minimal CRISPR-Cas12-like nuclease. High-throughput functional screening of AI-generated variants yielded editors that retained or exceeded wild-type activity in bacterial, plant and human cells. Cryo-EM-based structure determination of the most divergent active variant revealed new stabilizing contacts in the RNA/DNA interfaces across conformational states, demonstrating the design potential of this approach. Together these results establish a strategy for creating non-natural RNA-guided nucleases and conformationally active nucleic acid binders, enlarging the designable protein space.",

Francisella-like lipoprotein (Flpp3), a key virulence factor unique to Francisella, plays critical roles in infection and immune evasion, making it a promising target for therapeutic development. However, the lack of well-defined binding pockets and structural information on native interactions has hindered structure-guided ligand discovery against Flpp3. Here, we used a combination of physics-based and deep-learning methods to design high-affinity miniprotein binders targeting two distinct sites on Flpp3. We identified four binders for site I with binding affinities ranging between 24-110 nM. For the second site, an initial binder showed a dissociation constant (K",

      "abstract": "The success of protein structure prediction by the deep learning method AlphaFold 2 naturally raises the question whether similar success can be achieved for RNA structure prediction. One reason for the success in protein structure prediction is that the structural space of proteins, at the fragment to domain levels, has been nearly complete for many years. Here, we examined the completeness of RNA fragment structural space at the di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-nucleotide levels. We show that the number of non-redundant structural fragments at the tetra- and penta-nucleotide levels is in the midst of exponential increase, suggesting that the structural space currently observed in RNA is far from complete. Thus, more concerted efforts are clearly needed to improve the speed and methods of experimental determination of RNA structures to go beyond the limited structural space observed in RNAs. Moreover, the reference frame made of three sugar-ring atoms near the base side (O4', C1', and C2') exhibits the least structural diversity among existing RNA structures, suggesting it as the most stable platform for building other parts of RNA structures.",
