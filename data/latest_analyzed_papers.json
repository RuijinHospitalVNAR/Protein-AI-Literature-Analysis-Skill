      "abstract": "The intricate three-dimensional structures of proteins dictate their diverse biological functions. Accurately representing these structures, particularly the fine-grained orientational relationships between amino acids, is crucial for understanding protein mechanisms and practical computational protein analysis. Current methodologies often fall short in capturing these essential geometric details. We introduce Orientation-Aware Graph Neural Networks (OA-GNNs), a novel deep learning framework that explicitly models local and global geometric characteristics, including inner-residue torsion angles and inter-residue orientations. OA-GNNs achieve this by uniquely extending neural network weights from scalars to 3D directed weights and by implementing an equivariant message passing paradigm that ensures SO(3)-equivariance. This approach allows for a richer, more geometrically meaningful processing of protein structural data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OA-GNNs significantly outperform existing methods in sensing orientational features and achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse computational biology tasks, including residue identification, computational protein design, model quality assessment, and protein function classification. Our findings highlight the power of orientation-aware learning and establish OA-GNNs as a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of protein structure-function relationships and for developing new therapeutic and biotechnological solutions.

      "abstract": "Leveraging artificial intelligence and deep learning to generate proteins de novo (a.k.a. 'synthetic proteins') has unlocked new frontiers of protein design. Deep learning models trained on protein structures can generate novel protein designs that explore structural landscapes unseen by evolution. This approach enables the development of bespoke binders that target specific proteins and domains through new protein-protein interactions. However, successful binder generation can suffer from low in silico success rates, often requiring thousands of designs and hundreds of GPU hours to obtain enough hits for experimental testing. While workstation implementations are available for binder design, these are limited in both scalability and throughput. There is a lack of efficient open-source protein design pipelines for high-performance computing (HPC) systems that can maximize hardware resources and parallelize the workflow efficiently. Here, we present 'ProteinDJ'-an implementation of a synthetic protein design workflow that is deployable on HPC systems using the Nextflow portable workflow management system and Apptainer containerisation. It parallelizes the workload across both GPUs and CPUs, facilitating generation and testing of hundreds of designs per hour, accelerating the discovery process. ProteinDJ is designed to be modular and includes RoseTTAFold Diffusion (RFdiffusion) or BindCraft for fold generation, ProteinMPNN or Full-Atom MPNN (FAMPNN) for sequence design, and AlphaFold2 or Boltz-2 for prediction and validation of designs and binder-target interfaces, with supporting packages for structural evaluation of designs.

      "abstract": "Energy models play a crucial role in the advancement of computational de novo protein engineering, enabling the design of novel proteins with tailored functionalities. Proteins serve as the foundation of biochemical processes, making their precise engineering essential for applications in biotechnology, medicine, and synthetic biology. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on modifying existing proteins, de novo engineering introduces entirely new constructs, a paradigm shift driven by energy-based strategies that guide protein folding, stability, and functionality through comprehensive simulations of energy landscapes. Computational techniques such as molecular dynamics (MD), thermodynamic integration, and Monte Carlo sampling are fundamental in evaluating designed proteins' stability and dynamic behavior. Widely used tools such as CHARMM, Amber, and Rosetta leverage advanced energy functions to optimize protein structures, facilitating accurate predictions of folding pathways and binding affinities. Additionally, the integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has significantly improved the speed and precision of energy-based modeling, enhancing the design and optimization process. This review systematically analyzes recent studies, provides quantitative benchmarking of major computational platforms, and presents a decision framework for method selection based on accuracy-cost-throughput trade-offs. By integrating classical force fields, quantum mechanical (QM) approaches, and AI-driven predictions with experimental validation, this work outlines a roadmap for advancing therapeutic and industrial protein design through synergistic physics-based and data-driven strategies.",

We compared 13 state-of-the-art generative protein models, assessing their ability to produce feasible, diverse, and novel protein monomers. Structural diffusion models generally create designs with higher confidence in predicted structures and more biologically plausible energy distributions, but exhibit limited diversity and strong sequence biases. Conversely, protein language models generate more diverse and novel designs but with lower structural confidence. We also evaluated these models' ability to generate unique proteins, conditionally based on the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease. Generative models were successful in producing functional enzymes, albeit with diminished activity compared to the wildtype TEV. Our systematic benchmarking provides a foundation for evaluating and selecting generative protein models, while highlighting the complementary strengths of different generative paradigms.

      "abstract": "Computational design of functional proteins is of both fundamental and applied interest. This study introduces a generative framework for co-designing protein sequence and structure in a unified process by modeling their joint distribution, with the goal of enabling cross-modality interactions toward coherent and functional designs. Each residue is represented by three distinct modalities (type, position, and orientation) and modeled using dedicated diffusion processes: multinomial for types, Cartesian for positions, and special orthogonal group SO(3) for orientations. To couple these modalities, we propose a unified architecture, ReverseNet, which employs a shared graph attention encoder to integrate multimodal information and separate projectors to predict each modality. We benchmark our models, JointDiff and JointDiff-x, on unconditional monomer design and conditional motif scaffolding tasks. Compared to two-stage design models that generate sequence and structure separately, our models produce monomer structures with comparable or better designability, while currently lagging in sequence quality and motif scaffolding performance based on computational metrics. However, they are 1-2 orders of magnitude faster and support rapid iterative improvements through classifier-guided sampling. To complement computational evaluations, we experimentally validate our approach through a case study on green fluorescent protein (GFP) design. Several novel, evolutionarily distant variants generated by our models exhibit measurable fluorescence, confirming functional activity. These results demonstrate the feasibility of joint sequence-structure generation and establish a foundation to accelerate functional protein design in future applications.

In this study, we systematically analyzed the entire human surfaceome, identifying approximately 4,500 targetable sites and introducing potential binding seeds for initiating protein design applications. To validate these seeds, we implemented two experimental approaches (protein scaffolding and peptide cyclization) on three representative targets (FGFR2, IFNAR2, and HER3).

Here, we report the accurate de novo design of voltage-gated anion channels, namely dVGACs. dVGACs adopt a 15-helix pentameric architecture featuring arginine constrictions within the transmembrane span and show voltage-dependent anions currents in patch-clamp experiments. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of dVGACs closely align with the design models. Cryo-EM structures and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the arginine constrictions undergo voltage-induced conformational changes, serving as both a voltage sensor and a selectivity filter as designed. Notably, the anion selectivity and voltage sensitivity of dVGACs can be tuned through targeted mutations for suppressing neuronal firing in situ. The ability to create ion channels with custom-designed conformational changes refreshes our insights into membrane biophysics and unveils diverse potential applications.",

However, Acrs that can inhibit biotechnologically relevant CRISPR systems are relatively rare and challenging to discover. To overcome this limitation, we describe a highly successful and rapid approach that leverages de novo protein design to develop new-to-nature proteins for controlling CRISPR-Cas activity. Here, using Leptotrichia buccalis CRISPR-Cas13a as a representative example, we demonstrate that Acrs designed using artificial intelligence (AIcrs) are capable of highly potent and specific inhibition of CRISPR-Cas13a nuclease activity. We present a comprehensive workflow for design validation and demonstrate AIcr functionality in controlling CRISPR-Cas13 activity in bacterial and human cells. The ability to design bespoke inhibitors of Cas effectors will contribute to the ongoing development of CRISPR-Cas tools in diverse applications across research, medicine, agriculture and microbiology.",

GDL overcomes these limitations by operating on non-Euclidean domains and by capturing the spatial, topological, and physicochemical features that govern protein function. This perspective provides a comprehensive and critical overview of GDL applications in stability prediction, functional annotation, molecular interaction modeling, and de novo protein design. It consolidates methodological principles, architectural diversity, and performance trends across representative studies, emphasizing how GDL enhances interpretability and generalization in protein science. Aimed at both computational method developers and experimental protein engineers, the review bridges algorithmic concepts with practical design considerations, offering guidance on data representation, model selection, and evaluation strategies. By integrating explainable artificial intelligence and structure-based validation within a unified conceptual framework, this work highlights how GDL can serve as a foundation for transparent, interpretable, and autonomous protein design.

      "abstract": "Despite recent breakthroughs in deep learning methods for protein design, existing computational pipelines remain rigid, highly specific, and ill-suited for tasks requiring non-differentiable or multi-objective design goals. In this report, we introduce BAGEL, a modular, open-source framework for programmable protein engineering, enabling flexible exploration of sequence space through model-agnostic and gradient-free exploration of an energy landscape. BAGEL formalizes protein design as the sampling of an energy function, either to optimize (find a global optimum) or to explore a basin of interest (generate diverse candidates). This energy function is composed of user-defined terms capturing geometric constraints, sequence embedding similarities, or structural confidence metrics. BAGEL also natively supports multi-state optimization and advanced Monte Carlo techniques, providing researchers with a flexible alternative to fixed-backbone and inverse-folding paradigms common in current design workflows. Moreover, the package seamlessly integrates a wide range of publicly available deep learning protein models, allowing users to rapidly take full advantage of any future improvements in model accuracy and speed. We illustrate the versatility of BAGEL on four archetypal applications: designing de novo peptide binders, targeting intrinsically disordered epitopes, selectively binding to species-specific variants, and generating enzyme variants with conserved catalytic sites. By offering a modular, easy-to-use platform to define custom protein design objectives and optimization strategies, BAGEL aims to speed up the design of new proteins. Our goal with its release is to democratize protein design, abstracting the process as much as possible from technical implementation details and thereby making it more accessible to the broader scientific community, unlocking untapped potential for innovation in biotechnology and therapeutics.",

The two main challenges in identifying such protein-based inhibitors lie in the extensive experimental effort required, including the generation of large libraries, and in tailoring the selectivity of inhibitors to enzymes with homologous structures. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) is being used to improve protein design by training on targeted libraries and identifying key interface mutations that enhance affinity and specificity. However, such ML-based methods are limited by inaccurate energy calculations and difficulties in predicting the structural impacts of multiple mutations. Here, we present an ML-based method that leverages HTS data to streamline the design of selective protease inhibitors. To demonstrate its utility, we applied our new method to find inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of homologous proteases involved in both physiological and pathological processes. By training ML models on binding data for three MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9), we successfully designed a novel N-TIMP2 variant with a differential specificity profile, namely, high affinity for MMP-9, moderate affinity for MMP-3, and low affinity for MMP-1. Our experimental validation showed that this novel variant exhibited a significant specificity shift and enhanced selectivity compared with wild-type N-TIMP2. Through molecular modeling and energy minimization, we obtained structural insights into the variant's enhanced selectivity. Our findings highlight the power of ML-based methods to reduce experimental workloads, facilitate the rational design of selective inhibitors, and advance the understanding of specific inhibitor-enzyme interactions in homologous enzyme systems.",

We experimentally characterise 41 solenoid designs, with α-solenoids consistently folding as intended, including one structurally validated design that closely matches the design model. All β-solenoids initially failed, reflecting the difficulty of designing β-strand majority proteins.

We argue that while indispensable, these tools can promote a view of coiled coils as static, singular structures. Challenging this, we highlight the structural plasticity of coiled coils, the remarkable and increasingly evident ability of these assemblies to adopt multiple distinct conformations and dynamically switch between states. To understand the energetic and mechanistic principles governing this complex behaviour, we explore the crucial role of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in providing atomistic insights that are inaccessible to static modelling. Finally, we look forward, considering how the next generation of coiled-coil bioinformatics must evolve to address these challenges to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the current explosion in genomic sequence data and the proliferation of AI-predicted protein structures.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of resistance mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein presents a challenge for monoclonal antibody treatments like sotrovimab. Understanding the structural, dynamic, and molecular features of these mutations is essential for therapeutic advancements. However, the intricate landscape of potential mutations and critical residues conferring resistance to mAbs like sotrovimab remains elusive. This study introduces an integrated framework that combines interface protein design, machine learning, hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methodologies, all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, and correlation analysis. Beginning with the interface-based design and analysis, this framework elucidates the interaction between sotrovimab and the S-protein, identifying pivotal residues and plausible resistance mutations. Machine learning algorithms then facilitate the identification of potential resistance mutations using structural-sequence-binding affinity-energetics features. The hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics approach subsequently evaluates the role of mutational residues as quantum regions, assessing their impact on stabilizing the macromolecular complex. To gain a deeper understanding of the dynamic behavior of these mutations, multiscale simulations comprising all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations were performed, revealing their structural, biophysical and energetic impacts. These simulations complemented the static predictions, capturing the conformational dynamics and stability of the mutants in presence of glycan in the S-protein. The accuracy of the predictions is validated by correlating identified resistance mutations with clinical-sequencing data and empirical evidence from sotrovimab-treated patients. Notably, two residues, E340 at the S-protein-sotrovimab interface and Y508 distal from it, and their designs, align with clinically observed resistance mutations.

However, clinical translation of human IFN-λ3 (hIFN-λ3) is hindered by limited thermostability, protease susceptibility, and rapid mucosal clearance. In this study, instability-prone elements in hIFN-λ3 are eliminated through artificial intelligence (AI)-based backbone remodeling and targeted surface hydrophobic patch engineering. A protease-sensitive loop is replaced with a de novo α-helix, which shields neighboring hydrophobic patches and forms a new hydrophobic core, yielding an engineered variant (hIFN-λ3-DE1) with enhanced thermostability (Tm > 90 °C), protease resistance, and preserved antiviral activity and structural integrity even after extended heat stress (two weeks at 50 °C). Further glyco-engineering introduces an N-linked glycan at a site distant from receptor-binding interfaces, improving solubility, production yield, and diffusion through synthetic nasal mucus. Intranasal administration of the resulting variant (G-hIFN-λ3-DE1) enables effective mucosal penetration and provides a more rapid onset of in vivo prophylactic protection against influenza A virus. These findings highlight a robust and versatile strategy that combines AI-driven structural design with glyco-engineering to develop scalable, bioavailable, and functionally enhanced nasal biologics for respiratory virus prophylaxis.",

Here, we describe an approach to simultaneously scaffold multiple functional sites in a single-domain protein using deep learning. We designed small single-domain immunogens, under 130 residues, that present three distinct and irregular motifs from respiratory syncytial virus. These motifs together comprise nearly half of the designed proteins; hence, the overall folds are quite unusual with little global similarity to proteins in the Protein Data Bank. Despite this, X-ray crystal structures confirmed the accuracy of presentation of each of the motifs and the multiepitope design yields improved cross-reactive titers and neutralizing response compared to a single-epitope immunogen. The successful presentation of three distinct binding surfaces in a small single-domain protein highlights the power of generative deep learning methods to solve complex protein design problems.",

Their interactions-hereafter referred to as PhPIs (Polyphenol-Protein Interactions)- affect key processes such as nutrient bioavailability, antioxidant activity, and therapeutic efficacy. However, these interactions remain challenging due to the structural diversity of polyphenols and the dynamic nature of protein binding. Traditional experimental techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS), along with computational tools such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) have offered important insights but face constraints in scalability, throughput, and reproducibility. This review explores how deep learning (DL) is reshaping the study of PhPIs by enabling efficient prediction of binding sites, interaction affinities, and MD using high-dimensional bio- and cheminformatics data. While DL enhances prediction accuracy and reduces experimental redundancy, its effectiveness remains limited by data availability, quality, and representativeness-particularly in the context of natural products. We critically assess current DL frameworks for PhPIs analysis and outline future directions, including multimodal data integration, improved model generalizability, and development of domain-specific benchmark datasets. This synthesis offers guidance for researchers aiming to apply DL in unraveling structure-function relationships of polyphenols, accelerating discovery in nutritional science and therapeutic development.",

This review highlights recent advances in electrochemical approaches that support the design and functional optimization of engineered redox proteins.

Additionally, the review examines how synthetic biology enables the construction of artificial electron transport pathways, and how nanostructured materials such as carbon nanotubes, metal-organic frameworks, and conductive polymers improve protein immobilization and charge conduction. Scalable production methods like recombinant expression and cell-free synthesis have increased the accessibility of these proteins for industrial applications.

Deep learning (DL) has shown promise in forecasting the effects of such mutations, but is hindered by two primary constraints. First, the structures of mutant proteins are often elusive to acquire. Secondly, PPI takes place dynamically, which is rarely integrated into the DL architecture design. To address these obstacles, we present a novel framework named Refine-PPI with two key enhancements. First, we introduce a structure refinement module trained by a mask mutation modeling (MMM) task on available wild-type structures, which is then transferred to produce the inaccessible mutant structures. Second, we employ a new kind of geometric network, called the probability density cloud network (PDC-Net), to capture 3D dynamic variations and encode the atomic uncertainty associated with PPI. Comprehensive experiments on SKEMPI.v2 substantiate the superiority of Refine-PPI over all existing tools for predicting free energy change. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our hallucination strategy and the PDC module in addressing the absence of mutant protein structure and modeling geometric uncertainty.",

Through sequence dimensionality reduction, exhaustive subsequence elucidation, and enriched motif elicitation, we identify 799 strong-binding sequences containing a canonical motif and 219 sequences harboring novel motifs with divergent docking conformations. These findings reveal an unanticipated depth and breadth in protein-binding plasticity. We propose that this integrated experimental-AI framework will facilitate the systematic exploration of protein interactions and enable the data-driven design of synthetic peptides.",

      "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful gene-editing tool. Its specificity and stability rely on complex allosteric regulation. Understanding these allosteric regulations is essential for developing high-fidelity Cas9 variants with reduced off-target effects. Here, we used a novel structure-based machine learning (ML) approach to systematically identify long-range allosteric networks in Cas9. Our ML model was trained using all available Cas9 structures, ensuring a comprehensive representation of Cas9's structural landscape. We then applied this model to Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) to demonstrate the feature selection process. Using Cα-Cα inter-residue distances, we mapped key allosteric networks and refined them through a two-stage SHAP feature selection (FS) strategy, reducing a vast feature space to 28 critical Lysine-Arginine (Lys-Arg) residue pairs that mediate SpCas9 interdomain communication, stability, and specificity. These Lys-Arg pairs initially shared a 46.5 Å inter-residue distance, but molecular dynamics simulations revealed distinct stabilization behaviors, indicating a hierarchical allosteric network. Further mutational analysis of R78A-K855A (M1) and R765A-K1246A (M2) identified an \"electrostatic valley,\" a stabilizing network where positively charged residues interact with negatively charged DNA to maintain SpCas9's structural integrity. Disrupting this valley through direct (M2) or allosteric (M1) mutations destabilized SpCas9's DNA-bound conformation, leading to distinct pathways for improving SpCas9 specificity. This study provides a new framework for understanding allostery in Cas9, integrating ML-driven structural analysis with MD simulations. By identifying key allosteric residues and introducing the electrostatic valley as a central concept, we offer a rational strategy for engineering high-fidelity Cas9 variants. Beyond Cas9, our approach can be applied to uncover allosteric hotspots in other enzyme regulations and rational protein design.",

Their designability is crucial to the development of biologics, with computational methods holding promise in accelerating the delivery of medicines to the clinic. Modeling antibody-antigen recognition is prohibitively difficult, with data paucity being one of the biggest hurdles. Current affinity datasets comprise a small number of experimental measurements, which are often not standardized between molecules. Here, we address these issues by creating a dataset of seven antigens with two antibodies each, for which we introduce a heterogeneous set of mutations to the CDR-H3 measured by ELISA. Each of the parental complexes has a known crystal structure. We perform benchmarking of state-of-the-art affinity prediction algorithms to gauge their effectiveness. Current computational methods exhibit substantial limitations in accurately predicting the effects of single-point mutations. In contrast, the older empirical, physics-based method FoldX performs well in identifying mutants that retain binding. These findings highlight the need for more resources like the one presented here, i.e. large, molecularly diverse, and experimentally consistent datasets.",

      "abstract": "Computational protein design using machine learning models has advanced rapidly since the introduction of AlphaFold2. There is now a suite of tools that enable in silico design of proteins with desired structures and properties. Most design workflows require fitting a designed backbone with a sequence that stabilizes it, and many machine learning sequence design models have been proposed. These models are trained to recover the native sequence paired with a known structure, a task known as native sequence recovery (NSR). Here, we demonstrate the limitations of optimizing a sequence design model only for NSR. We show that NSR is often misaligned with more important metrics of model performance: the compatibility of the generated sequence with the desired fold and the ability of the model to predict the energetic effects of mutations. We introduce PottsMPNN, which is trained to generate a Potts energy function consisting of single-residue and residue-pair terms from a protein backbone, and we demonstrate that learning a Potts model reduces NSR but improves sequence generation and energy prediction. To further show that NSR is not the optimal metric, we trained PottsMPNN with noised backbone structures and multiple sequence alignments. In tests on held-out data, NSR decreased, but the quality of the designed sequences and energy predictions improved. By demonstrating the limitations of optimizing for NSR and the effectiveness of alternative strategies for avoiding over-optimizing for NSR, our work provides a new direction for the sequence design field.",

Annotations were curated using highly specific multiplex immunofluorescence and transferred to co-registered AF for model training. All FTUs (except the descending thin limb) and gross kidney morphology were segmented with high accuracy: >0.85 F1-score, and Dice-Sorensen coefficients >0.80, respectively. This workflow allowed lipids, profiled by imaging mass spectrometry, to be quantitatively associated with segmented FTUs.

Yet, protein bioengineering poses unique challenges for sequence representation, as experimental datasets typically feature few mutations, which are either sparsely distributed across the entire sequence or densely concentrated within localized regions. This limits the ability of sequence-level representations to extract functionally meaningful signals. In addition, comprehensive comparative studies remain scarce, despite their crucial role in clarifying which representations best encode relevant information and ultimately support superior predictive performance. In this study, we systematically evaluate multiple ProtBERT and ESM2 embedding variants as sequence representations, using the adeno-associated virus capsid as a case study and prototypical example of bioengineering, where functional optimization is targeted through highly localized sequence variation within an otherwise large protein. Our results reveal that, prior to fine-tuning, amino acid-level embeddings outperform sequence-level representations in supervised predictive tasks, whereas the latter tend to be more effective in unsupervised settings. However, optimal performance is only achieved when embeddings are fine-tuned with task-specific labels, with sequence-level representations providing the best performance. Moreover, our findings indicate that the extent of sequence variation required to produce notable shifts in sequence representations exceeds what is typically explored in bioengineering studies, showing the need for fine-tuning in datasets characterized by sparse or highly localized mutations.",

Among these, Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domains are widespread photosensors that control diverse physiological processes and are increasingly used in optogenetics. Yet, the evolutionary constraints that shaped their protein dynamics and thereby their functional diversity remain poorly resolved. Here we systematically characterize the dynamics of 21 natural LOV core domains, significantly extending the spectroscopically resolved catalog through the addition of 18 previously unstudied variants. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we uncover an exceptional kinetic diversity spanning from picoseconds to days and identify distinct functional clusters within the LOV family. These clusters reflect evolutionary branching, including a divergence of ≈1.0 billion years between investigatedLOV variants from plants and ≈0.4 billion years of separation within one of these functional clusters. Individual variants with extreme photocycles emerge as promising anchor points for optogenetic applications, ranging from highly efficient adduct formation to ultrafast recovery. Beyond natural diversity, we introduce a LOV domain generated by artificial intelligence-guided protein design. Despite being sequentially remote from its maternal template, this variant retains core photocycle function while exhibiting unique biophysical properties, thereby occupying a new region on the biophysical landscape. Our work emphasizes how billions of years of evolution defined LOV protein dynamics, and how protein design can expand this repertoire, engineering next-generation optogenetic tools.",

We validate the approach with high-throughput determination of inactive state structures of four pharmaceutically relevant GPCRs, allowing for key details of receptor pharmacology to be resolved in each case. We then engineered an extracellular fiducial marker for the prototypical β2-adrenergic receptor that enabled direct structural characterization of the rearrangement of key intracellular motifs in the absence of G-protein.
