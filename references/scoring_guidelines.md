- **Medium (4-7):** Potential applications with further development, addresses important needs
- **Low (1-3):** Limited practical applications, theoretical focus without clear use cases

**Key Indicators:**
- Use of the words: "application", "practical", "implementation", "real-world"
- Focus on therapeutic or industrial applications
- Clear pathways to experimental validation
- Potential for commercial or clinical impact
- Addresses specific challenges in protein engineering workflows

## Scoring Process

### 1. Initial Scoring
Each paper is scored independently on each of the four criteria by analyzing the title, abstract, and full text (when available).

### 2. Weighted Calculation
The final importance score is calculated using the weighted formula:

```
Final Score = (Novelty × 0.3) + (Impact × 0.25) + (Technical Innovation × 0.25) + (Applicability × 0.2)
```

### 3. Contextual Adjustment
The initial score is adjusted based on:
- Field-specific significance
- Comparison to existing literature
- Potential for future research
- Alignment with current research trends

### 4. Final Validation
Scores are validated against:
- Expert annotations (when available)
- Citation potential
- Consistency with established scoring patterns

## Scoring Examples

### Example 1: High-Scoring Paper

**Paper:** "AlphaFold 3: Accurate structure prediction for complex protein assemblies"

**Scoring:**
- Novelty: 9/10 (Major advancement in structure prediction)
- Impact: 10/10 (Likely to revolutionize the field)
- Technical Innovation: 9/10 (Significant algorithmic improvements)
- Applicability: 9/10 (Direct practical applications in multiple fields)

**Final Score:** (9×0.3) + (10×0.25) + (9×0.25) + (9×0.2) = 9.25/10

### Example 2: Medium-Scoring Paper

**Paper:** "Diffusion models for protein sequence generation with improved diversity"

**Scoring:**
- Novelty: 7/10 (Extends diffusion models to protein design)
- Impact: 6/10 (Contributes to generative protein design)
- Technical Innovation: 7/10 (Improves existing diffusion methodologies)
- Applicability: 6/10 (Potential applications in protein engineering)

**Final Score:** (7×0.3) + (6×0.25) + (7×0.25) + (6×0.2) = 6.65/10

### Example 3: Low-Scoring Paper

**Paper:** "Minor modifications to existing protein design algorithms"

**Scoring:**
- Novelty: 2/10 (Limited originality)
- Impact: 3/10 (Incremental contributions)
- Technical Innovation: 2/10 (Minor algorithmic adjustments)
- Applicability: 3/10 (Limited practical applications)

**Final Score:** (2×0.3) + (3×0.25) + (2×0.25) + (3×0.2) = 2.45/10

## Best Practices

### When Scoring
- Read the entire paper when possible
- Consider the paper's context within the field
- Focus on objective criteria rather than subjective impressions
- Maintain consistency across similar papers
- Document scoring rationale for transparency

### Common Pitfalls
- Overvaluing technical complexity at the expense of practical relevance
- Undervaluing incremental improvements that address important problems
- Being influenced by publication venue rather than content
- Failing to consider long-term impact potential
- Inconsistent application of scoring criteria

## Calibration

Regular calibration is essential to maintain scoring consistency:

1. **Inter-rater reliability:** Compare scores with other evaluators
2. **Temporal consistency:** Re-evaluate papers periodically
3. **Benchmarking:** Use established high-impact papers as reference points
4. **Feedback incorporation:** Adjust scoring based on field developments

## Conclusion

The importance scoring system provides a structured framework for evaluating AI & protein design literature. By considering multiple dimensions of scientific contribution, it helps identify the most significant and impactful research in this rapidly evolving field.

When used consistently and with attention to context, these guidelines ensure that scoring reflects the true scientific value of each paper, facilitating better decision-making and research prioritization.
