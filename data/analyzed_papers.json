      "abstract": "Leveraging artificial intelligence and deep learning to generate proteins de novo (a.k.a. 'synthetic proteins') has unlocked new frontiers of protein design. Deep learning models trained on protein structures can generate novel protein designs that explore structural landscapes unseen by evolution. This approach enables the development of bespoke binders that target specific proteins and domains through new protein-protein interactions. However, successful binder generation can suffer from low in silico success rates, often requiring thousands of designs and hundreds of GPU hours to obtain enough hits for experimental testing. While workstation implementations are available for binder design, these are limited in both scalability and throughput. There is a lack of efficient open-source protein design pipelines for high-performance computing (HPC) systems that can maximize hardware resources and parallelize the workflow efficiently. Here, we present 'ProteinDJ'-an implementation of a synthetic protein design workflow that is deployable on HPC systems using the Nextflow portable workflow management system and Apptainer containerisation. It parallelizes the workload across both GPUs and CPUs, facilitating generation and testing of hundreds of designs per hour, accelerating the discovery process. ProteinDJ is designed to be modular and includes RoseTTAFold Diffusion (RFdiffusion) or BindCraft for fold generation, ProteinMPNN or Full-Atom MPNN (FAMPNN) for sequence design, and AlphaFold2 or Boltz-2 for prediction and validation of designs and binder-target interfaces, with supporting packages for structural evaluation of designs. ProteinDJ democratizes protein binder design through its robust and user-friendly implementation and provides a framework for future protein design pipelines.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the development of generative models for de novo protein design. We compared 13 state-of-the-art generative protein models, assessing their ability to produce feasible, diverse, and novel protein monomers. Structural diffusion models generally create designs with higher confidence in predicted structures and more biologically plausible energy distributions, but exhibit limited diversity and strong sequence biases. Conversely, protein language models generate more diverse and novel designs but with lower structural confidence. We also evaluated these models' ability to generate unique proteins, conditionally based on the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease. Generative models were successful in producing functional enzymes, albeit with diminished activity compared to the wildtype TEV. Our systematic benchmarking provides a foundation for evaluating and selecting generative protein models, while highlighting the complementary strengths of different generative paradigms. This framework will facilitate an informed application of these tools for bio-medical engineering and design.",

      "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence, protein engineering, and sustainable nanomedicine is driving a paradigm shift in theranostics by enabling highly precise disease diagnosis and targeted therapy. AI-driven methodologies, including machine learning and deep learning, facilitate the rapid analysis of complex biological and chemical datasets, accelerating protein structure prediction, molecular docking, and structure-activity relationship modeling. These capabilities support the rational design of proteins and peptides with enhanced specificity, therapeutic efficacy, and safety, while enabling personalized treatment strategies tailored to individual molecular profiles. In parallel, sustainable nanomedicine focuses on the development of biodegradable, biocompatible, and environmentally benign nanomaterials to improve drug bioavailability, stability, and controlled release. AI-assisted optimization further refines nanocarrier design by balancing therapeutic performance with safety and environmental impact. Advanced intelligent nanocarriers capable of real-time monitoring, adaptive drug release, and degradation into non-toxic by-products represent a significant advancement over conventional static systems. The theranostic paradigm has become central to precision medicine, particularly in oncology, especially where AI-designed nanoplatforms enable targeted delivery of imaging agents and therapeutics to tumors, while allowing continuous treatment monitoring and minimizing off-target effects. Emerging applications in neurological, infectious, and cardiovascular diseases further highlight the broad clinical potential of this approach. Accordingly, this review summarizes AI-driven protein design strategies, sustainable nanocarrier engineering, and their convergence in next-generation theranostic systems, critically discussing mechanistic insights, translational challenges, and design principles required for developing safe, scalable, and clinically adaptable intelligent nanomedicines.",

De novo protein binder design against these cell surface proteins offers a promising yet underexplored strategy for drug development. However, the vast search space and limited data on natural or competitive binders have historically limited experimental success. In this study, we systematically analyzed the entire human surfaceome, identifying approximately 4,500 targetable sites and introducing potential binding seeds for initiating protein design applications. To validate these seeds, we implemented two experimental approaches (protein scaffolding and peptide cyclization) on three representative targets (FGFR2, IFNAR2, and HER3). Our results revealed a high success rate, showing that seeds provide valuable starting points for binder design against our identified targetable sites, as well as the need for constant improvements of computational protein design pipelines utilizing machine learning and physics-based methods. Additionally, we present SURFACE-Bind, an interactive database offering open access to all generated data. The high-throughput computational design methods and target-specific binder seeds established here pave the way for a new generation of targeted therapeutics for the human surfaceome.",

      "abstract": "Selective inhibitors are essential for targeted therapeutics and for probing enzyme functions in various biological systems. The two main challenges in identifying such protein-based inhibitors lie in the extensive experimental effort required, including the generation of large libraries, and in tailoring the selectivity of inhibitors to enzymes with homologous structures. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) is being used to improve protein design by training on targeted libraries and identifying key interface mutations that enhance affinity and specificity. However, such ML-based methods are limited by inaccurate energy calculations and difficulties in predicting the structural impacts of multiple mutations. Here, we present an ML-based method that leverages HTS data to streamline the design of selective protease inhibitors. To demonstrate its utility, we applied our new method to find inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of homologous proteases involved in both physiological and pathological processes. By training ML models on binding data for three MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9), we successfully designed a novel N-TIMP2 variant with a differential specificity profile, namely, high affinity for MMP-9, moderate affinity for MMP-3, and low affinity for MMP-1. Our experimental validation showed that this novel variant exhibited a significant specificity shift and enhanced selectivity compared with wild-type N-TIMP2. Through molecular modeling and energy minimization, we obtained structural insights into the variant's enhanced selectivity. Our findings highlight the power of ML-based methods to reduce experimental workloads, facilitate the rational design of selective inhibitors, and advance the understanding of specific inhibitor-enzyme interactions in homologous enzyme systems.",

However, many automated methods act as black boxes, limiting mechanistic insight. Here we highlight the continuing importance of rational protein design, defined as an approach rooted in physical principles, chemical intuition, and sequence-structure-function relationships. We outline three complementary strategies: backbone-first, sequence-first, and function-first, which provide interpretable design frameworks and enable robust scaffold generation, motif incorporation, and functional engineering. Looking forward, we argue that hybrid workflows combining rational principles with machine learning offer the most promising route to dynamic, explainable, and generalizable protein design.",

      "abstract": "Effective representations of protein sequences are widely recognized as a cornerstone of machine learning-based protein design. Yet, protein bioengineering poses unique challenges for sequence representation, as experimental datasets typically feature few mutations, which are either sparsely distributed across the entire sequence or densely concentrated within localized regions. This limits the ability of sequence-level representations to extract functionally meaningful signals. In addition, comprehensive comparative studies remain scarce, despite their crucial role in clarifying which representations best encode relevant information and ultimately support superior predictive performance. In this study, we systematically evaluate multiple ProtBERT and ESM2 embedding variants as sequence representations, using the adeno-associated virus capsid as a case study and prototypical example of bioengineering, where functional optimization is targeted through highly localized sequence variation within an otherwise large protein. Our results reveal that, prior to fine-tuning, amino acid-level embeddings outperform sequence-level representations in supervised predictive tasks, whereas the latter tend to be more effective in unsupervised settings. However, optimal performance is only achieved when embeddings are fine-tuned with task-specific labels, with sequence-level representations providing the best performance. Moreover, our findings indicate that the extent of sequence variation required to produce notable shifts in sequence representations exceeds what is typically explored in bioengineering studies, showing the need for fine-tuning in datasets characterized by sparse or highly localized mutations.",
